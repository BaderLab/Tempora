Title: Pathway-based Trajectory Inference for Time-series Single Cell RNA-Seq Data
Version: 0.1.08
Author: Thinh Tran 
Maintainer: Thinh Tran <thinh.tran@nyu.edu>
Description: Tempora is a trajectory inference method that infers cell lineage maps from time-series scRNAseq data using pathway enrichment profiles of single cells and experimental time information. Tempora uses an information theoretic approach to build a trajectory at the cluster level based on the clustersâ€™ pathway enrichment profiles, effectively connecting cell types and states across multiple time points. Taking advantage of the available time information, Tempora can infer the directions of all connections in a trajectory that go from early to late clusters.
